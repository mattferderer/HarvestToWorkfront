# Harvest to Workfront time entry migration tool

Copies time entries from Harvest & moves them over to Workfront.

To use, copy this down & update the URLs & IDs. This app also requires copying the cookie before running from the network tab once you're logged in to Workfront.

This code expects that Harvest tasks are named with the Workfront Task ID inside parenthesis in the Harvest task name.

This is a quick prototype that works. Leave an issue if you have questions.
